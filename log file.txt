When I use probit formulation, I have to sample omega|delta and delta|omega

The problem of this is that, when I sample omega|delta, a generate random variables from truncated normal distributions, where the truncation limits depend on the value of z_il. The problem is that even if we have tons of positive omegas and only a few negative omegas, depending on the value of the corresponding delta, we might end up with positive omegas equal to a bunch of zeroes (the lower bound) and some relatively large negative omegas

As a result, when I then do delta|omega, delta is likely to be relatively negative, which is definitively not what the data suggests it should be.

Works well with known mu and sd1. Careful attention has to be given when generating fake data since these data need to have the following characteristics:

a) delta: delta's can't range to very small or very big values (MH with random walk does not work for this)
b) theta: each group should dominate at least some locations for this to be estimable.

delta's are not estimated very well for last groups. This might be due to the fact that we are using a very small sig2. As a result, we might be running  into delta x betas identifiability problems for these last groups as there is not much information on the data.

estimate sig2

1) code works well when phi[4,]=phi.true[4,] and ncomm=4
2) when I eliminate "phi[4,]=phi.true[4,]" but keep ncomm=4, does it still work? yes, it works!
3) when I eliminate "phi[4,]=phi.true[4,]" but use ncomm=20, does it still work? yes, it works!

1) code seems to work well with simple logistic regression but no gaussian second stage regression

Underlying Gaussian regression
1) code works with ncomm.true=4
2) code does not work with ncomm.true=9 regardless if I initialize the algorithm with the results from the unstructured LDA. 
The problem is that the algorithm is lumping groups together. It seems that even the unstructure LDA lumps groups together.
3) If I increase the number of species from 100 to 300, does this problem go away? No, we also need to:
a - increase the number of trees in each location from 100-200 to 100-400
b - change the prior for phi from Dirichet(1) to Dirichlet(0.1)

It works for estimating theta!!! But what about betas and sig2?

1) Extreme values of delta might lead to very small changes in loglik. 
Nevertheless, this would dramatically change the betas

2) We can get the same theta values with 
a) large sig2 and bad betas
b) small sig2 and good betas
